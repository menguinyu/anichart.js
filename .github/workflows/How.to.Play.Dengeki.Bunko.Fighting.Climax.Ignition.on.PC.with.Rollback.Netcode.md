However, thanks to the efforts of some dedicated fans, you can now play Dengeki Bunko: Fighting Climax Ignition on PC with English translation and rollback netcode. Rollback netcode is a technique that improves the online experience of fighting games by reducing input delay and lag. It is widely considered to be superior to the traditional delay-based netcode that most fighting games use.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and install Dengeki Bunko: Fighting Climax Ignition on PC with rollback netcode. You will need a Windows PC with at least 4 GB of RAM and a decent internet connection. You will also need a controller or an arcade stick to play the game.
 
## Step 1: Download the game files
 
The first step is to download the game files from this link: [https://mega.nz/file/8Z0wzQgA#6k9y8x0WZm7lYwFfQwV7sXnWfjJmYH9XZbL7xKqGn0c](https://mega.nz/file/8Z0wzQgA#6k9y8x0WZm7lYwFfQwV7sXnWfjJmYH9XZbL7xKqGn0c). This is a fan-made version of the game that includes the latest update (v1.04), all the DLC characters and stages, and the English patch. The file size is about 2.5 GB.
 
After downloading the file, extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should get a folder named "Dengeki Bunko Fighting Climax Ignition". Inside this folder, you will find two subfolders: "Game" and "Rollback".
 
## Step 2: Install the rollback netcode
 
The next step is to install the rollback netcode that will allow you to play online with other players. To do this, you need to join the official Dengeki Bunko: Fighting Climax Ignition Discord server: [https://discord.gg/c8D33kazNj](https://discord.gg/c8D33kazNj). This is where you can find other players to play with, ask questions, report bugs, and get updates on the project.
 
Once you join the Discord server, go to the #download-and-installation channel and follow the instructions there. You will need to download two files: "DFCI.exe" and "DFCI.ini". These are the files that enable the rollback netcode. Copy these files into the "Rollback" folder inside your game folder.
 
After that, run "DFCI.exe" as administrator. This will launch the game with rollback netcode enabled. You can change some settings in the "DFCI.ini" file, such as your region, your name, and your preferred input delay. You can also adjust some graphics options in the game's launcher.
 
## Step 3: Enjoy the game
 
Now you are ready to play Dengeki Bunko: Fighting Climax Ignition on PC with rollback netcode. You can access the online mode from the main menu by selecting "Network".
